Internal java project, prepared by me for Paurus. 
Task 2, fast load of data from file to database.

Instructions for testing: 
* download ZIP and unpack in an empty project folder
* use mySQL server for testing, because "load data" sql script is mySQL specific; create only database schema, table is created by this application;  
* Open projet's resource file "config.properties" and adjust settings for database connection and file path; 
  read further instructions there  
* start application (class FileToDbLoader): table foo_random, defined in "load_data.sql" will be created and "load data" script executed
* check imported data in table foo_random
